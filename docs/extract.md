## Overview

The reuse of ontology terms creates links between data, making the ontology and the data more valuable. But often you want to reuse just a subset of terms from a target ontology, not the whole thing. Here we extract a "STAR" module for the term 'adrenal cortex' and its supporting terms:

    robot extract --method STAR \
        --input filtered.owl \
        --term-file uberon_module.txt \
        --output results/uberon_module.owl

See <a href="/examples/uberon_module.txt" target="_blank">`uberon_module.txt`</a> for an example of a term file. Terms should be listed line by line in either CURIE form or full IRI, and comments can be included with one or more whitespace characters after the term followed by `#` and then the comment.

Alternatively, individual terms can be specified with `--term` followed by the CURIE (or full URI).

The `--method` options fall into two groups: Syntactic Locality Module Extractor (SLME) and Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term (MIREOT).

- STAR: use the SLME to extract a fixpoint-nested module
- TOP: use the SLME to extract a top module
- BOT: use the SLME to extract a bottom module
- MIREOT: extract a simple hierarchy of terms

## Syntactic Locality Module Extractor (SLME)

Each SLME module type takes a "seed" that you specify with `--term` and `--term-file` options. From the seed it builds a module with a "signature" that includes the seed plus any other terms required so that any logical entailments are preserved between entities (classes, properties and individuals) in the signature. For example, if an ontology implies that A is a subclass of B, and the seed contains A and B, then the module will also imply that A is a subclass of B. In other words, the module will contain all the axioms needed to provide the same entailments for the seed terms (and resulting signature) as the full ontology would.

- BOT: The BOT, or BOTTOM, -module contains mainly the terms in the seed, plus all their super-classes and the inter-relations between them. The module is called BOT (or BOTTOM) because it takes a view from the BOTTOM of the class-hierarchy upwards. Modules of this type are typically of a medium size and should be used if there is a need to include all super-classes in the module. This is the most widely used module type - when in doubt, use this one.

- TOP: The TOP-module contains mainly the terms in the seed, plus all their sub-classes and the inter-relations between them. The module is called TOP because it takes a view from the TOP of the class-hierarchy downwards. Modules of this type are typically large and should only be used if there is a need to include all sub-classes in the module.

- STAR: The STAR-module contains mainly the terms in the seed and the inter-relations between them (not necessarily sub- and super-classes). Modules of this type are typically very small and should be used if the module needs to be of minimal size containing only (or mostly) the classes in the seed file.

- [ModuleType source code](http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/apidocs_4/uk/ac/manchester/cs/owlapi/modularity/ModuleType.html)

ROBOT expects any `--term` or IRI in the `--term-file` to exist in the input ontology. If none of the input terms exist, the command will fail with an [empty terms error](errors#empty-terms-error). This can be overridden by including `--force true`. 

### Instances

__Important note for ontologies that include individuals:__ When using the SLME method of extraction, all individuals (ABox axioms) and their class types (the TBox axioms they depend on) are included by default. The `extract` command provides an `--individuals` option to specify what (if any) individuals are included in the output ontology:
* `--individuals include`: all individuals in the input ontology and their class types (default)
* `--individuals minimal`: only the individuals that are a type of a class in the extracted module
* `--individuals definitions`: only the individuals that are used in logical definitions of classes
* `--individuals exclude`: no individuals

## MIREOT

The MIREOT method preserves the hierarchy of the input ontology (subclass and subproperty relationships), but does not try to preserve the full set of logical entailments. Both "upper" (ancestor) and "lower" (descendant) limits can be specified, like this:

    robot extract --method MIREOT \
        --input uberon_fragment.owl \
        --upper-term "obo:UBERON_0000465" \
        --lower-term "obo:UBERON_0001017" \
        --lower-term "obo:UBERON_0002369" \
        --output results/uberon_mireot.owl

To specify upper and lower term files, use `--upper-terms` and `--lower-terms`. The upper terms are the upper boundaries of what will be extracted. If no upper term is specified, all terms up to the root (`owl:Thing`) will be returned. The lower term (or terms) is required; this is the limit to what will be extracted, e.g. no descendants of the lower term will be included in the result.

To only include all descendants of a term or set of terms, use `--branch-from-term` or `--branch-from-terms`, respectively. `--lower-term` or `--lower-terms` are not required when using this option.

Note that if the same IRI is used for both a class and an individual, MIREOT will ignore the individual and only extract the class.

For more details see the [MIREOT paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AO-2011-0087).

## Subset

The subset method extracts a sub-ontology that contains only the seed terms (that you specify with `--term` and `--term-file` options) and the relations between them. This method uses the [relation-graph](https://github.com/balhoff/relation-graph) to materialize the existential relations among the seed terms. Procedurally, the subset method materializes the input ontology and adds the inferred axioms to the input ontology. Then filters the ontology with the given seed terms. Finally, it reduces the filtered ontology to remove redundant subClassOf axioms.

    robot extract --method subset \
        --input subset.obo \
        --term "obo:ONT_1" \
        --term "obo:ONT_5" \
        --term "BFO:0000050" \
        --output results/subset_result.owl
        
ROBOT expects any `--term` or IRI in the `--term-file` to exist in the input ontology. If none of the input terms exist, the command will fail with an [empty terms error](errors#empty-terms-error). This can be overridden by including `--force true`. 

### Intermediates

When extracting (especially with MIREOT), sometimes the hierarchy can have too many intermediate classes, making it difficult to identify relevant relationships. For example, you may end up with this after extracting `adrenal gland`:
```
- material anatomical entity
  - anatomical structure
    - multicellular anatomical structure
      - organ
        - abdomen element
          - adrenal/interrenal gland
            - adrenal gland (*)
    - lateral structure
      - adrenal gland (*)
```
By specifying how to handle these intermediates, you can reduce unnecessary intermediate classes:
* `--intermediates all`: default behavior, do not prune the ontology
* `--intermediates minimal`: only include intermediate intermediates with more than one *sibling* (i.e. the parent class has another child)
* `--intermediates none`: do not include any intermediates
  * For MIREOT, this will only include top and bottom level classes.
  * For any SLME method, this will only include the classes directly used in the logic of the input terms

Running this command to extract, inclusively, between 'material anatomical entity' and 'adrenal gland':

    robot extract --method MIREOT \
        --input uberon_fragment.owl \
        --upper-term UBERON:0000465 \
        --lower-term UBERON:0002369 \
        --intermediates minimal \
        --output results/uberon_minimal.owl

Would result in the following structure:
```
- material anatomical entity
  - anatomical structure
    - adrenal gland (*)
    - organ
      - adrenal gland (*)
```

You can chain this output into reduce to further clean up the structure, as some redundant axioms may appear.

Running the same command, but with `--intermediates none`:

    robot extract --method MIREOT \
        --input uberon_fragment.owl \
        --upper-term UBERON:0000465 \
        --lower-term UBERON:0002369 \
        --intermediates none \
        --output results/uberon_none.owl

Would result in:
```
- material anatomical entity
  - adrenal gland
```

Any term specified as an input term will not be pruned.

## Handling Imports

By default, `extract` will include imported ontologies. To exclude imported ontologies, just add `--imports exclude` for any non-MIREOT extraction method:

    robot extract --method BOT \
      --catalog catalog.xml \
      --input imports-nucleus.owl \
      --term GO:0005739 \
      --imports exclude \
      --output results/mitochondrion.owl

This only includes what is asserted in `imports-nucleus.owl`, which imports `nucleus.owl`. `imports-nucleus.owl` only includes the term 'mitochondrion' (`GO:0005739`) and links it to its parent class, 'intracellular membrane-bounded organelle' (`GO:0043231`). `nucleus.owl` contains the full hierarchy down to 'intracellular membrane-bounded organelle'. The output module, `mitochondrion.owl`, only includes the term 'mitochondrion' and this subClassOf statement.

By contrast, including imports returns the full hierarchy down to 'mitochondrion', which is asserted in `nucleus.owl`:

    robot extract --method BOT \
      --catalog catalog.xml \
      --input imports-nucleus.owl \
      --term GO:0005739 \
      --imports include \
      --output results/mitochondrion-full.owl

## Extracting Ontology Annotations

You can also include ontology annotations from the input ontology with `--copy-ontology-annotations true`. By default, this is false.

    robot extract --method BOT \
      --input annotated.owl \
      --term UBERON:0000916 \
      --copy-ontology-annotations true \
      --output results/annotated_module.owl
      
## Adding Source Annotations

`extract` provides an option to annotate extracted terms with `rdfs:isDefinedBy`. If the term already has an annotation using this property, the existing annotation will be copied and no new annotation will be added.

    robot extract --method BOT \
      --input annotated.owl \
      --term UBERON:0000916 \
      --annotate-with-source true \
      --output results/annotated_source.owl 

The object of the property is, by default, the base name of the term's IRI. For example, the IRI for `GO:0000001` (`http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0000001`) would receive the source `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go.owl`. 

Sometimes classes are adopted by other ontologies, but retain their original IRI. In this case, you can provide the path to a [term-to-source mapping file](/examples/source-map.tsv) as CSV or TSV.

    robot --prefix 'GO: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_' \
      extract --method BOT \
      --input annotated.owl \
      --term UBERON:0000916 \
      --annotate-with-source true \
      --sources source-map.tsv \
      --output results/changed_source.owl

The mapping file can either use full IRIs:

```
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000001,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl
```

Or prefixes, as long as the [prefix is valid](/global#prefixes):

```
BFO:0000001,RO
```
